In this paper, we propose a novel training scheme, namely Teach-DETR, to construct proper supervision from teacher detectors for training more accurate and robust DETR models. We find that the predicted bounding boxes of teacher detectors can serve as an effective bridge to transfer knowledge between RCNN-based detectors and DETR-based detectors. We make the following important observations: first, the bounding boxes are the unbiased representation of objects for all detectors, which would not be affected by the discrepancies in detector frameworks, label assignment strategies, etc. Second, introducing more box annotations would greatly unleash the capacity of object queries by training them with various one-to-one assignment patterns, and thus improve training efficiency and detection performance. Finally, leveraging the predicted bounding boxes of teacher detectors would not introduce additional architectures, since it has the similar format to the ground truth (GT) boxes. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to integrate the GT annotations with the auxiliary supervisions. Due to the one-to-one matching of query-label assignment of DETR-based detectors, incorporating the auxiliary supervisions would be harmful to maintain the key signature of DETR of enabling inference without NMS. To tackle the challenge of transferring knowledge acrossdifferent types of detectors, we propose a solution that aligns with our observations and utilize output boxes and scores of the teacher detectors as extra independent and parallel supervisions for training the queries' outputs. In addition, we employ the output scores of teacher detectors to measure the quality of the auxiliary supervisions and accordingly assign the predicted boxes different importance for weighting their losses.The ambiguity between GT boxes and the imperfect boxes from teachers can be alleviated and therefore enhance the importance of GT boxes.

在本文中，我们提出了一种新的训练方案，即Teach-DETR，用于从教师检测器中构建适当的监督，以训练更准确和鲁棒的DETR模型。我们发现教师检测器的预测边界盒可以作为基于rcnn检测器和基于DETR检测器之间知识传递的有效桥梁。我们做了以下重要的观察:首先，包围框是所有检测器对象的无偏表示，它不会受到检测器框架、标签分配策略等差异的影响。其次，引入更多的框注释可以通过各种一对一分配模式训练对象查询，从而极大地释放对象查询的能力，从而提高训练效率和检测性能。最后，利用教师检测器的预测边界盒不会引入额外的体系结构，因为它具有与ground truth (GT)盒类似的格式。然而，将GT注释与辅助监督集成起来并非易事。由于基于DETR的检测器的查询标签分配是一对一匹配的，引入辅助监督将不利于保持DETR的启用推理的关键签名。为了解决在不同类型的检测器之间传输知识的挑战，我们提出了一种与我们的观察相一致的解决方案，并利用输出框和大量的教师检测器作为额外的独立和并行监督来训练查询的输出。此外，我们使用教师检测器的输出分数来衡量辅助监督的质量，并相应地赋予预测框不同的重要度来加权其损失。可以缓解GT盒子和老师不完善的盒子之间的模糊性，从而提高GT盒子的重要性。

 

Our method aims to transfer knowledge of teacher detectors to train a more accurate and robust DETR-based detector.  (i) We introduce the predicted bounding boxes of multiple teacher detectors, which can be RCNN-based detectors, DETR-based detectors or even both types of detectors, to serve as auxiliary supervisions for training DETR;  (ii) We weight the corresponding losses of the auxiliary supervisions with the predicted box scores from teacher detectors.  In this section, we will ﬁrst retrospect DETR [1] (Sec. 3.1) and present details of Teach-DETR in (Sec. 3.2).
